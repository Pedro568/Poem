This is just a simple poem of my Life.
the sun is here
the moon is gone.
here am i
with great food enought.
Be happy, be strong.
take heart buddy
don't  quit.
Go on.

Here I'm walking!
I'm going to the road.
the direction i know, the street has name though.
first a step, then i walk.
I'm peter and I'm keep walking on.
